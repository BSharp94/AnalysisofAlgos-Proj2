17. Write a that takes two text files (each having at most 5000
characters, though if you are able to do larger, feel free to do so) and
find longest sequence of text that appears in both files.

Example.

File 1: abcdefg

File 2: dabczzzzzz

The answer is abc

Analyze the O() running time of your algorithm and demonstrate it on
several example inputs of varying length (report the actual run time for
each).

Bonus: Implement two different algorithms and compare.

Super Bonus: Input two text files and find the shortest "marker": a string
that appear in one file but not the other.
